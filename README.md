# HRNet project

## Description
This project is the final project of the Openclassrooms Front-End Developer path. The aim of this project was to transform a jQuery project into a React project in order to increase the application's performance. We also had to create our own npm plugin and publish it, as well as use external plugins to remake the application.

Application performance control was done with LightHouse.

You can find the jQuery project [here](https://github.com/jucroizer/P14_Front-end)
You can find the publish plugin [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dropdown-menu-input-react-1) and the source code [here](https://github.com/jucroizer/dropdown-menu-input-react)
